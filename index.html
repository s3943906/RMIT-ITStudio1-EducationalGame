    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this Educational Game where you will go through many 
       questions containing various obstacles (such as Java Coding Problems). 
       In order to reach to the end you will need to make decisions as what to do 
       and where to go in order to reach the end.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        To play, you will be prompted with difficult scenarios as your progress through
        the game. You will be given a list of choices to choose from that will help you overcome
        said scenario. Choose the one that you think will be the most effiecent and from there you
        will trigger an event (Java Coding Problem). You must carefully read what the event is asking of you
        and you must answer correctly. If you fail to give a correct answer you will be penalised and go back to
        the start of the game. Repeat this until you reach the end (That is when you can say you have
        beaten this game).
